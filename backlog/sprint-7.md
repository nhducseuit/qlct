- [ ] Access control/escalation for household members (moved from Sprint 5)
# Sprint 7: Multi-User Onboarding & Permissions

**Sprint Goal:** Expand the application to support multiple users by implementing invitation and role management functionalities.

## Key Features & User Stories

- **As a family administrator,** I want to invite other members to join my "Big Family" and assign them to their respective "Small Family" units.
- **As a new user,** I want to accept an invitation and register an account that is automatically linked to the correct family structure.

## Technical Backlog

- [ ] **UI - User Management:** Create a new page or section for inviting users via email.
- [ ] **Backend - Invitation System:** Implement API endpoints and logic to generate, send, and process user invitations.
- [ ] **Backend - RBAC:** Implement backend guards and logic for `SmallFamilyAdmin` and `BigFamilyAdmin` roles to control access to administrative features.
- [ ] **Frontend - Auth Flow:** Update the registration process to handle invitation tokens.

## UI/UX Refinements & Bug Fixes (Completed in Sprint 7)

- [x] **Robust Family-Aware UI:** Ensured that all forms and lists for transactions, categories, and household members are now fully aware of the current family context, preventing data leakage between families.
- [x] **Consistent UI/UX:** Harmonized the display and sorting logic for family groupings across the `Categories` and `Household Members` pages for a unified user experience.
- [x] **Clean Group Headers:** Removed redundant annotations like "(Nh√≥m con)" from family group headers for a cleaner look.
- [x] **Bug Fix: Dialog Interaction:** Fixed a bug where the transaction edit dialog could not be closed by pressing the Escape key or clicking the backdrop.
- [x] **Bug Fix: Vue SFC Structure:** Resolved runtime and build errors related to Vue Single File Component structure and type safety.
- [x] **Data Integrity:** Corrected TypeScript types and store logic to ensure `familyId` is handled correctly throughout the application, resolving multiple type errors.
