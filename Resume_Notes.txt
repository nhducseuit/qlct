- Last Major Task Completed: "Successfully tested CRUD APIs for Transactions, completing backend work for Categories, Household Members, and Transactions as per Sprint 2."
- Backend real-time synchronization mechanism (Task S2.2.3) implemented with NotificationsGateway and integrated into backend services (Category, HouseholdMember, Transaction).
- Current Sprint: Sprint 2.
- Currently working on Frontend Integration (Tasks S2.3.x):
    - `categoryStore.ts` (S2.3.4) refactored for backend API & WebSockets.
    - `householdMemberStore.ts` (S2.3.8) created and refactored for backend API & WebSockets.
    - `transactionStore.ts` (S2.3.5) refactored for backend API & WebSockets.
    - `socketService.ts` refactored for more robust singleton WebSocket connection management.
- Completed: Thorough testing of real-time updates across multiple browser tabs for Categories, Household Members, and Transactions. WebSocket stability and UI updates confirmed.
- Next Likely Focus: Proceed with remaining frontend UI tasks (S2.3.9, S2.3.10, S2.3.11), starting with S2.3.9 (Category Management UI).
- Key Decisions/State: "Authentication is currently bypassed for DEV mode (using 'dev-user'). UI updates in stores currently rely on WebSocket events (optimistic updates deferred as per S2.3.6 sub-objective)."
- Sprint 2: Multi-User Synchronization & Cloud Backend successfully completed. All backend APIs (Categories, Transactions, Household Members) with real-time sync via WebSockets are functional and tested. Frontend stores refactored. Docker environment stabilized. Ready for Sprint 3.
