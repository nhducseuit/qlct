Sprint 2, focusing on "Multi-User Synchronization & Cloud Backend," has been successfully completed. Key accomplishments include:

Backend: Fully functional CRUD APIs for Categories, Household Members, and Transactions are complete. A real-time synchronization mechanism using WebSockets (via NotificationsGateway) has been implemented and integrated into these backend services.
Frontend: Pinia stores (categoryStore, householdMemberStore, transactionStore) have been refactored to integrate with the new backend APIs and WebSockets. The socketService was also improved for robust connection management. Real-time UI updates for all three entities have been thoroughly tested and confirmed stable across multiple browser tabs.
Development Environment: The Docker environment has been stabilized. Authentication is currently bypassed for development mode, with the system using a default 'dev-user'. UI updates in the stores are primarily driven by WebSocket events, with optimistic updates deferred for now.
The project is now ready to move into Sprint 3. The immediate next focus will likely be on completing the remaining frontend UI tasks from Sprint 2, starting with the Category Management UI (S2.3.9).
