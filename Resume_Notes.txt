Sprint 2, focusing on "Multi-User Synchronization & Cloud Backend," has been successfully completed. Key accomplishments include:

Backend: Fully functional CRUD APIs for Categories, Household Members, and Transactions are complete. A real-time synchronization mechanism using WebSockets (via NotificationsGateway) has been implemented and integrated into these backend services.
Frontend: Pinia stores (categoryStore, householdMemberStore, transactionStore) have been refactored to integrate with the new backend APIs and WebSockets. The socketService was also improved for robust connection management. Real-time UI updates for all three entities have been thoroughly tested and confirmed stable across multiple browser tabs.
Development Environment: The Docker environment has been stabilized. Authentication is currently bypassed for development mode, with the system using a default 'dev-user'. UI updates in the stores are primarily driven by WebSocket events, with optimistic updates deferred for now.
The project is now ready to move into Sprint 3. The immediate next focus will likely be on completing the remaining frontend UI tasks from Sprint 2, starting with the Category Management UI (S2.3.9).

**Recent Refinements & Fixes (Post-Sprint 2):**

*   **WebSocket Stability:** Resolved issues causing WebSocket connections to drop or listeners to become detached, particularly after page navigation or specific store actions. This involved:
    *   Refining `authStore` logic for development mode to prevent unintended listener clearing.
    *   Removing unnecessary `onUnmounted` hooks from Pinia stores.
*   **Frontend UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   `QuickEntryForm.vue`: Prevented date field from resetting after successful transaction submission.
    *   `QuickEntryForm.vue`: Ensured correct hierarchical display order for categories in the selection dropdown.
    *   `QuickEntryForm.vue`: Improved usability of the "Ch·ªçn nhanh" (pinned categories) section on mobile devices (increased height, adjusted text size).
    *   Applied "Times New Roman" as the global font family for consistent styling.
    *   **Authentication:** Modified `JwtAuthGuard` in the backend to consistently allow 'dev-user' access for HTTP APIs in development mode, aligning with WebSocket dev authentication.
*   **Backend Seeding:** Added seed data for `PredefinedSplitRatio` to provide default sharing options.
*   **Sprint 3 - Financial Summaries & Analytics (Backend):**
    *   Implemented API endpoints for:
        *   Total income/expense summaries (monthly, quarterly, yearly).
        *   Income/expense breakdown by category for a specific period (month, quarter, year), filterable by categories, and including budget limits per category.
        *   Income/expense breakdown by household member for a specific period.
        *   Average monthly expenses for a specific period, filterable by categories.
        *   Budget vs. actual spending comparison across all categories with budgets.
        *   Monthly budget vs. actual expense trend data for a selected year and categories.
*   **Sprint 3 - Financial Summaries & Analytics (Frontend - Reports Page):**
    *   Established `ReportsPage.vue` with global filters (Year, Month, Category).
    *   Implemented `MonthlyBudgetExpenseTrendChart.vue` showing monthly expenses vs. budget limits, allowing users to click a month to update detail views.
    *   Enhanced `CategoryBreakdownReport.vue` to display:
        *   A pie chart for expense distribution per category.
        *   A bar chart comparing actual expenses vs. budget limits per category.
        *   A detailed table of expenses per category.
    *   The Category Breakdown report is now interactively driven by the month selected on the Trend Chart or the global Month filter, and by the global Category filter.
    *   Successfully integrated Highcharts for these visualizations, resolving associated TypeScript and ESLint challenges.

**Current Status:** The application is significantly more stable, especially regarding real-time updates. The immediate focus is now on **Sprint 3: Financial Summaries & Analytics**. Following that, the plan includes Sprint 4 (Shared Expense Balancing & Settlements) and Sprint 5 (AI & remaining UI enhancements).
