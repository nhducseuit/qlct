Sprint 2, focusing on "Multi-User Synchronization & Cloud Backend," has been successfully completed. Key accomplishments include:

Backend: Fully functional CRUD APIs for Categories, Household Members, and Transactions are complete. A real-time synchronization mechanism using WebSockets (via NotificationsGateway) has been implemented and integrated into these backend services.
Frontend: Pinia stores (categoryStore, householdMemberStore, transactionStore) have been refactored to integrate with the new backend APIs and WebSockets. The socketService was also improved for robust connection management. Real-time UI updates for all three entities have been thoroughly tested and confirmed stable across multiple browser tabs.
Development Environment: The Docker environment has been stabilized. Authentication is currently bypassed for development mode, with the system using a default 'dev-user'. UI updates in the stores are primarily driven by WebSocket events, with optimistic updates deferred for now.
The project is now ready to move into Sprint 3. The immediate next focus will likely be on completing the remaining frontend UI tasks from Sprint 2, starting with the Category Management UI (S2.3.9).

**Recent Refinements & Fixes (Post-Sprint 2):**

*   **WebSocket Stability:** Resolved issues causing WebSocket connections to drop or listeners to become detached, particularly after page navigation or specific store actions. This involved:
    *   Refining `authStore` logic for development mode to prevent unintended listener clearing.
    *   Removing unnecessary `onUnmounted` hooks from Pinia stores.
*   **Frontend UI/UX Enhancements:**
    *   `QuickEntryForm.vue`: Prevented date field from resetting after successful transaction submission.
    *   `QuickEntryForm.vue`: Ensured correct hierarchical display order for categories in the selection dropdown.
    *   `QuickEntryForm.vue`: Improved usability of the "Ch·ªçn nhanh" (pinned categories) section on mobile devices (increased height, adjusted text size).
    *   Applied "Times New Roman" as the global font family for consistent styling.
    *   **Authentication:** Modified `JwtAuthGuard` in the backend to consistently allow 'dev-user' access for HTTP APIs in development mode, aligning with WebSocket dev authentication.
*   **Backend Seeding:** Added seed data for `PredefinedSplitRatio` to provide default sharing options.

**Sprint Progress & Key Achievements:**
*   Sprint 2 (Multi-User Synchronization & Cloud Backend) is complete.
*   **Sprint 3 (Financial Summaries & Analytics)** is currently in progress. See `sprint-3.md` for detailed objectives and progress.
    *   **Backend:**
        *   Summary APIs (totals, category breakdown, member breakdown, budget trend) enhanced to support filtering by selected household members.
        *   Added a new backend endpoint and service method to query transactions with detailed filters (category, period, members) to support report drill-downs.
    *   **Frontend (Reports Page):**
        *   Implemented a global multi-select filter for Household Members.
        *   **Category Breakdown Report:**
            *   Made charts (pie and bar) interactive: clicking a category shows its detailed transactions.
            *   Added a transaction detail table that appears when a category is selected (from table or charts).
            *   Included a button to navigate to the full transaction list from the detail view.
        *   **Member Breakdown Report:**
            *   Added a bar chart to visualize income/expenses per member.
            *   The entire section is now collapsible by default.
        *   Resolved various TypeScript, ESLint, and API integration issues for robust report generation.

    *   **UAT Feedback & Enhancements (Sprint 3):**
        *   **QuickEntryForm:**
            *   Fixed issue preventing falsy validation errors after successful transaction addition by using `nextTick`.
            *   Ensured the "Payer" field retains its value after a successful transaction addition.
        *   **Reporting:** Implemented a user-controlled global filter (checkbox) to exclude/include income transactions from all reports, with backend services updated to respect this filter. Income aggregation logic in `CategoryBreakdown` and `MemberBreakdown` services was corrected to display income when not excluded.
        *   **PDF Export:** Added client-side PDF export functionality for reports using `jspdf` and `html2canvas`, including layout adjustments for A4 portrait and basic pagination. Optimized image scale and provided print-specific CSS for better PDF output and reduced file size.

*   **Sprint 4 (Shared Expense Balancing & Settlements)** - In Progress:
    *   **Backend:**
        *   Defined `Settlement` data model in Prisma schema, including relationships with `User` and `HouseholdMember`.
        *   Implemented API endpoint (`GET /settlements/balances`) and service logic to calculate net balances between household members. The calculation considers shared transactions, their split ratios, and adjusts for any previously recorded settlements.
        *   Implemented API endpoint (`POST /settlements`) and service logic to record new settlements between members, including validation for payer/payee and active status.
        *   Created necessary DTOs (`MemberBalanceDto`, `DetailedMemberBalanceDto`, `BalancesResponseDto`, `CreateSettlementDto`, `SettlementDto`) for these operations.
**Next Sprints:**
*   Sprint 4: Shared Expense Balancing & Settlements
*   Sprint 5: AI & remaining UI enhancements
