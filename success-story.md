# Sprint 2: Multi-User Synchronization & Cloud Backend - A Success!

**Sprint Goal Recap:** Transform the application to support multiple users across different devices with real-time data synchronization. This involved introducing a backend service, a centralized database, and the groundwork for user authentication.

---

## Key Achievements:

*   **Robust Backend Foundation:** Successfully established a NestJS backend, providing a scalable and maintainable server-side application.
*   **Centralized Database:** Designed and implemented a PostgreSQL database schema using Prisma ORM, defining models for Users, Categories, Transactions, and Household Members.
*   **Comprehensive APIs:** Developed secure CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API endpoints for:
    *   User Authentication (registration/login groundwork).
    *   Categories, including handling for nested structures and default share ratios.
    *   Household Members.
    *   Transactions, with logic for custom and default split ratios.
    All data operations are scoped to the authenticated user (currently 'dev-user' for development).
*   **Real-Time Synchronization:** Implemented a WebSocket-based notification system (via `NotificationsGateway`) integrated into backend services. This allows changes made by a user on one device to be reflected in real-time on their other connected clients for Categories, Household Members, and Transactions.
*   **Frontend Store Refactoring:** Updated frontend Pinia stores (`categoryStore`, `householdMemberStore`, `transactionStore`) to communicate with the new backend APIs and to listen for and react to WebSocket events for real-time data updates.
*   **Containerization & Deployment:** Successfully containerized the backend (NestJS) and database (PostgreSQL) using Docker and Docker Compose. This involved resolving complex path alias issues for TypeScript and ensuring the Prisma query engine was compatible with the Alpine Linux environment in Docker. The frontend build process was also updated to correctly target the backend API.
*   **Thorough Testing:** Conducted successful tests of CRUD operations and real-time data synchronization across multiple browser tabs/clients, confirming the stability and functionality of the system.

**Impact:** The application has been successfully transformed from a local, single-user application into a multi-user, cloud-native platform with real-time data synchronization capabilities. This lays a critical and strong foundation for all future feature development and scalability.

**Next Steps:** With the core backend and real-time infrastructure in place, the project is well-positioned to proceed to Sprint 3, focusing on reporting features, debt management, and further UI enhancements.
